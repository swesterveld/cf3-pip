The cf3-pip repo contains an extension written for the CFEngine 3 library. Goal
was to have a means to easily manage Python packages from a CFEngine setup.

With this extension Python package manager 'pip' -- which is an acronym for
'pip installs packages' -- is supported as one of the package managers
available in CFEngine. It makes it possible to install and remove Python
packages globally as well as in a virtual environment. For the latter you'll
need an environment with the Python package 'virtualenv'.


The extension itself can be found in the file 'pip.cf'.

An example of how to use the extension can be found in the example-directory.
To try it yourself, you should copy these files, together with 'pip.cf' and the
CFEngine 3 standard library ('cfengine_stdlib.cf') to a single directory, and
issue the following command from that directory:

    cf-agent -v -K -f ./promises.cf
